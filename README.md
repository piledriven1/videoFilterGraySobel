# Sobel Filter

## About

This repository is a collaboration between Yexall and I to create an efficient Sobel filtering program in C++ that runs on a Raspberry Pi 4B/5.

## Prerequisites

This program requires the user to have the opencv library installed to function.
For a Debian-based operating system (i.e. Raspbian or Ubuntu), this can be done as shown:
```
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt autoremove -y
sudo apt install libopencv-dev -y
```
